📁 Single‑File Projects Collection
Welcome to the Single‑File Projects Collection – a lightweight repository that hosts a variety of tiny, self‑contained programs written in different programming languages.
Each project lives in its own folder and is packaged as a single source file (or a single source file plus a minimal README), so you can drop it into your environment and run it straight away.
